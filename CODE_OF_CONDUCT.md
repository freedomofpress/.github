# Code of Conduct for Freedom of the Press Foundation Open Source Projects

## Preamble

Freedom of the Press Foundation engages with contributors from all over the world,
who help us further press freedom in a variety of ways—including software development,
advocacy, operations, mentorship, reporting and building connections with great people
and organizations.

To work together effectively in a large, diverse and open community, we have a few
ground rules that we expect everyone to adhere to when they work with us on open source projects.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces and events managed by Freedom of the Press Foundation
in support of its open source projects. This includes GitHub repositories, online chat systems,
forums, hosted or sponsored events and any other venues created by the contributor community
which are used for communication.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can and cannot do. Rather, take it
in the spirit in which it’s intended: a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us
and the communities in which we participate.

We take violations of this code outside these spaces into account when determining a person's
ability to participate within them. Members of the community should not hesitate to contact
the Community Moderation and Safety Team ("[Community Team](#community-team-members)")
if they feel someone has violated this Code of Conduct, or if they have questions or concerns.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Contributors to our work should feel safe and welcome. They should enjoy participating
in discussions and contributing. To these ends, members of the community should:

- **Be friendly and patient.** Your work will be used by other people,
  and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Remember that our community
  is international, and that the people you interact with may be communicating
  with you in a language that is not their native tongue.

- **Assume good faith and good intentions.** Disagreements—both social and
  technical—happen all the time. Our diverse backgrounds give us the ability
  to see things from many different perspectives, but they can also lead to
  misunderstandings. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  constructively, and that we do not jump to conclusions about each other's
  motives.

- **Be welcoming, considerate, and respectful.** We strive to be a community that
  welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes,
  but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national
  origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
  level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size,
  family status, political belief, veteran status, religion, and mental and physical ability.

- **Be careful in the words you choose.** Exclusionary behavior is
  unacceptable. Refer to the Definitions section below for examples
  of what we consider to be unacceptable behavior.

- **Listen and communicate openly and honestly.** Yield the floor to
  others, and help to make sure that everyone gets heard. In other words, try to
  be your best self. In doing so, you contribute the health and longevity of
  this community.

## Definitions

As a member of the community, you are expected to never engage in the following intimidating, harassing, or insulting behaviors:

  - Discriminatory (e.g., racist or sexist) jokes and language
  - Inappropriate names for user accounts, servers, files, repositories, etc.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
  - Personal insults
  - Misgendering or deadnaming
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
  - Physical intimidation
  - Obscene gestures
  - Stalking
  - Demeaning another person
  - Unwelcome following, in virtual or physical spaces
    (e.g. making accounts with the purpose of evading blocks)
  - Enlisting the help of others, whether in person or online, in order to
    target an individual
  - Taking photographs, video, or audio recordings of someone without their consent
  - Sustained disruption of talks, events, or meetings
  - Inappropriate physical contact
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Revealing other people's personal details ("doxing") without consent, or threatening to do so.
  - Violation of people's stated personal boundaries
  - Misrepresenting association with FPF and its projects, and/or misrepresenting
    FPF’s work, mission, or views in a public forum.
  - Misrepresenting yourself as a member of a marginalized community, or speaking over members
    of a marginalized group on their own experiences. (This does not include signal boosting!
    Signal boosting others on the issues they face is encouraged.)

Finally, don’t follow the letter of this Code of Conduct while disregarding its spirit.
When judging whether certain behavior represents a violation of this code, we will consider a violation
in spirit (e.g., clearly behaving in a damaging or obnoxious manner in a way not explicitly specified)
to be no different from any other violation of this code.
That includes trolling and other forms of consistently disruptive behavior.

## Enforcement

We do not tolerate unacceptable behavior from any community member, and there are no exceptions
for those in positions of power such as maintainers, sponsors, funders or other individuals
with decision making authority. Further, people in positions of power can wield it to exacerbate
the effects of harassment and to diminish the repercussions.
For these reasons, those who are informal or formal leaders are held to a higher standard.

Anyone asked by another community member to stop unacceptable behavior is
expected to comply immediately. Bear in mind that you should not act
on another person’s behalf unless they have asked you to do so.

### How to get help

The [Community Team](#community-team-members) is made up of established members of the community
who assist with resolving conflicts within the community. The members of the
Community Team are listed below.

You can contact the whole Community Team or members individually.

You should contact the Community Team if you have questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct
(including improvements) or if you feel that you have witnessed a Code of Conduct violation.
In the event of a violation either directed at yourself or someone else, please contact the
Community Team as soon as possible through whatever analog or digital medium you are most comfortable with.

Should your report be about any member of the Community Team or if there is a conflict of interest,
that member will recuse themselves from the conflict resolution proceedings.
They will not be involved with the discussion, documentation, communications,
or decisions made by the rest of the Community Team with regards to the incident.

## What the person reporting a violation can expect

The Community Team will respond to reports as quickly as possible. When responding to a report,
the Community Team will prioritize the safety of the person(s) who have been harmed or are at
risk of harm and the reporter(s). No actions will be taken without the consent of the person
who has been harmed or is at risk of harm except in cases where danger or harm are imminent.

All reports to the Community Team, no matter how minor or severe, will be taken seriously and investigated.

## How the Community Team responds to incidents

The Community Team does not have a fixed set of responses to some enumerated set of incidents that may occur.
The Community Team operates on a case-by-case basis taking into account past behavior;
the relationship between the person(s) who were harmed and the person(s) causing the harm;
the responses of the person(s) who caused harm; and the perceived threat of future harm.

Actions the Community Team may take to mitigate harm include, but are not
limited to:

- A simple warning
- Informal mediation
- A temporary ban from email lists, chat channels, repositories or other online
  communication mediums
- A temporary ban from events or community spaces
- Permanent exclusion from the community

Once the Community Team has reached a decision on how to mitigate the harm or risk of harm,
the person(s) on the receiving end of the mitigation(s) may appeal the decision by writing
or otherwise communicating with the Community Team.
